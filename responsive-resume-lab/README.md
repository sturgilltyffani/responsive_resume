# Objectives
- Style your page to look "exactly" like the template.
- You can make it anybody's resume. It doesn't have to be Queen RiRi (if it is it won't get you bonus points, even though the points don't matter).
- Put in your own pictures and information.
- Here is the static website for reference: http://resume-lab.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/

## Requirements
- You must use Sass and Materialize to complete this lab.
- The footer and contact box must only use Sass.
- You can use any combination of Materialize/Sass to complete the lab.
- You MUST use the Materialize Navbar, Parallax, Responsive Video, and Carousel Components.
- You MUST use Sass partials, nesting, mixins, extend, and variables (just a note: you don't have to nest everything, just use nesting where you think it makes sense to do so).
- Feel free to add extra things if you want!

## Due Date
- Tuesday September 26th at 9:05am.

## Communication
- Since I will be out Friday September 22nd and Monday September 25th, I will not be able to answer any questions. There is no one else on staff who can answer coding questions either. So make use of online resources and on each other in order to complete the lab. Do your best to do the lab yourself without anyone else's help because that will be the most beneficial to you! You are welcome to Slack me questions, I can't promise I will get back to you within a resonable amount of time, but I might...
